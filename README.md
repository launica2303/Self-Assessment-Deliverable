# Self-Assessment-Deliverable
## Self-assessment
Overall, I wish I could have done better throughout the program. I feel I did my best given my personal circumstances. I tried to make the right choices for myself and my family as well as fulfilling my obligations to the program as well as I could. As far as being a good team player for my team, I wish I could have done more for them. 
## Team assessment
My team members performance was amazing. Each of them worked hard to accomplish their individual task as well as pulling together to cover where I was lacking. Even though they could have, they did not make me feel bad or hold it against me for what little I could contribute. The level of professionalism and talent they each possess is admirable. I know they will each have a very successful data analytics career. I pray for nothing but success for them all.
## Summary of the project
I feel very proud to be a part of a final project that I am very passionate about. I feel that at the level it is at now and all the possibilities to be improved upon it will have a very positive impact on helping to bring awareness to, as well as helping to fight against human trafficking. As mentioned before the level of talent my teammates displayed in making this project such a success is very impressive.
